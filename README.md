# News Aggregator with JavaEE Back-End and Vue.JS Front-End

This project is a geolocation-based news aggregator composed of:

- A JavaEE back-end deployed on the Wildfly application server.
- A VueJS TypeScript front-end.

The back-end employs several noteworthy technologies including:

- **Context Dependency Injection (CDI):** CDI enhances flexibility, reusability, and manageability by providing a component's dependencies from external sources.
- **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):** ORM facilitates integration between object-oriented programming systems and relational database management systems (RDBMS).
- **Server-Side Cache:** Stores frequently accessed data to speed up application performance by reducing the need for repeated data retrieval or computation.
- **REST with JSON Web Token (JWT):** Utilized for secure communication between the front-end and back-end.

The front-end is developed using Vue.js (Version 3) and incorporates elements of Material Design. Key technologies utilized in the front-end include:

- **State Management with Vuex:** Vuex is employed for efficient state management within the application.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Asynchronous Design with Axios and Promises:** Enables non-blocking, asynchronous requests to the back-end server for enhanced performance.

For styling, the CSS framework Tailwind is utilized.
